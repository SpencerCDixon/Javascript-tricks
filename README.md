## Javascript Tricks

This GitBook was inspired by my desire to finally actually **learn** javascript
and not just know enough to get by.  I wanted a place to organize all
the information I learned through research, trial & error, and building real
production apps.

This quote was a driving force for me to take the plunge:

I've spent the last year learning Ruby, Rails, and Object Oriented Programming.
When appropriate I'll do my best to relate the new ideas I'm learning to my old
language.  However, part of this journey is to challenge my current ways of
thinking, which is why I want to dive into React and Functional programming.
